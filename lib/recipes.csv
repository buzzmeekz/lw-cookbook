Happy Meal,Go to McDonnalds and ask them to make it
Cheese Fondue With Beer and Bourbon,"Ah, Babybel cheese, the fancy French chef’s secret weapon for fondue—it keeps the molten mixture from separating, and its unassuming flavor lets the Gruyère shine."
Slow-Cooker Beef and Two-Bean Chili,"This chili pleases all palates in my house—it's not too spicy or too mild, but it's loaded with flavor. I love the combination of black beans and chickpeas, but you can use any type of legumes you like. What really makes the chili, in my opinion, are the toppings! Some sharp cheddar, a dollop of cumin-cilantro sour cream, and diced red onions are a must. Sometimes I even add some crushed tortilla chips."
Beer-Steamed Mussels with Chorizo,"Add a green salad, and dinner’s on the table in less than half an hour."
